# Angelopp — A Local USSD Visibility Network

## 1. What Angelopp Is
Angelopp is a USSD-first visibility network that makes existing local economic activity visible without taking control away from the people involved. It is not a platform that manages users or transactions. It is simple infrastructure that reveals what is actually available right now — using one shared phone number that works on every device.

## 2. Why USSD and One Number
USSD is universal, fast, and trusted across Africa. By using a single number, Angelopp becomes a shared reference point for a community. People no longer need to guess, call multiple numbers, or rely on apps and data bundles. The menu reflects reality, not predictions or rankings.

## 3. Local Ownership and Governance
Angelopp is designed to be locally owned and governed, typically through SACCOs or community structures. Rules, categories, and norms belong to the community, not to a remote company. Youth “touts” support onboarding and accuracy on the ground, strengthening trust and adoption instead of replacing human relationships.

## 4. Non-Extractive by Design
Angelopp does not sell data, manipulate visibility, or extract value through algorithms. Visibility is voluntary. Drivers and businesses decide when they appear. The system surfaces reality and then steps aside. Data stays local and serves local decision-making, not external optimization.

## 5. Pilot-Ready Architecture
This repository contains the integrated USSD backend and a minimal web landing page. The backend is designed to run behind an Africa’s Talking callback via Nginx. The database lives on the server and is excluded from version control. Angelopp is built to start small — one village, one category — and grow step by step through real use.
